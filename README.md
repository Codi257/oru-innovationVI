Designed as a web interface to be used among various members of the St. Louis Continuum of Care (CoC), specifically homeless shelters.

The primary goal is to have a central database and web application that can be used to store a shelter's availability for each night as well as information for each client who stays the night. The shelter data would then be viewable and searchable to find an appropriate shelter that has openings for a homeless person searching for a place to stay the night, especially if the current shelter is full.

The use of a central database helps promote data sharing among CoC members the hope is to add metrics to analyse and view the collected.
